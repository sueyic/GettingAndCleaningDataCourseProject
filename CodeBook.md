Code book for data produced by steps 4 and 5 of `run_analysis.txt`

Step 4 produces a tidy dataset with four variables. The dimensions are "subject", "activity", and "variable". The measure is "value". Each row is a unique observation on "subject", "activity", and "variable".

Allowable values
* subject: Numbers 1 through 30, where each number represents a person as a test subject.

* activity: There are 6 activities performed by test subjects: "walking", "walkingUpstairs", "walkingDownstairs", "sitting", "standing", "laying"

* variable: Feature which represents a direct or derived measurement from the accelerometer or gyrometer. For details on the features, please see `data/features_info.txt`. There are in total 60 features, which are as follows.
